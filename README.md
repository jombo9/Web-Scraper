# Web-Scraper
A web scraper is a program that sends HTTP requests to a web server, 
retrieves the HTML content of a web page and then extracts useful information from it.
This is a basic web scraper that requests the HTML content of a specified webpage (in this case, "https://example.com") using the http.Get function.
This basic scraper can be extended to extract more complex information by modifying the goquery selectors and processing logic to target different elements or attributes within the HTML document.
